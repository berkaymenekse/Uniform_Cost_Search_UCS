# Uniform_Cost_Search_UCS
Uniform Cost Search implemented using Priority Queue

One of the topics of this course in which artificial intelligence is explained
is Uniform Cost Search. This algorithm, one of the pathfinding algorithms, is
the subject of the first project. This algorithm is written in Python language and
implemented by implementing Priority Queue.
